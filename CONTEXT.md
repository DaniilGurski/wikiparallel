# WikiParallel

A browser-only tool that takes a problem written in plain language and returns
Wikipedia articles from unrelated disciplines that describe the same underlying
problem, so a person can borrow ideas across fields.

## Language

**Challenge**:
The problem a person types in, phrased in plain language (for example,
"handling a sudden surge of users"). The single input to a search.
_Avoid_: query, prompt, question

**Parallel**:
A Wikipedia article that the tool returns for a Challenge because its lead
section is close to the Challenge in embedding space and it sits in a different
Field. The unit of output.
_Avoid_: match, result, hit, analogy

**Field**:
One of the 11 top-level sections of the Vital Articles Level 3 list: People,
History, Geography, Arts, Philosophy and religion, Everyday life, Society and
social sciences, Health and medicine, Science, Technology, Mathematics. Every
Corpus article belongs to exactly one Field, taken from the section it appears
under. The exact names are read from the live list at build time.
_Avoid_: domain, discipline, category, topic

**Home Field**:
The Field the person marks as the one their Challenge already belongs to.
Articles in the Home Field are excluded from the Parallels, which is how the
tool "skips the obvious answers".
_Avoid_: source field, own field, excluded category

**Corpus**:
The fixed set of ~1,000 articles from Wikipedia's Vital Articles Level 3 list,
each reduced to its Lead Section plus its list of section headings and embedded
once at build time.
_Avoid_: dataset, index, database

**Lead Section**:
The text of a Wikipedia article before its first heading. The only part of an
article WikiParallel embeds and the text shown to the person as evidence of a
Parallel.
_Avoid_: summary, intro, abstract, extract

**Closeness**:
The similarity between a Challenge and a Parallel, shown to the person as a
whole number from 0 to 100 (cosine similarity of the two Embeddings, times 100).
A rough ordering cue, not a probability or a quality score.
_Avoid_: score, relevance, confidence, distance

**Embedding**:
The fixed-length vector produced from a piece of text by the one small model the
tool uses. The same model embeds Lead Sections at build time and Challenges in
the browser at search time.
_Avoid_: vector (when precision matters, prefer Embedding), encoding
